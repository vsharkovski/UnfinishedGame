# UnfinishedGame

## What is this?

I followed a course by Dave Churchill about Game Development, and used this repository to store my code.

Dave Churchill's website: http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/teaching.shtml

## Setup

- Install SFML 2.5.1, the Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 32-bit version.
- Add an environment variable called SFML_DIR, leading to the SFML installation directory.
- Add "%SFML_DIR%\bin" to the PATH environment variable.
- Open the Visual Studio solution file.
- Build. Note that only Win32 is supported.
